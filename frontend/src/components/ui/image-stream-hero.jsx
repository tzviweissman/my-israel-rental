/**
 * ImageStreamHero — two rails of image cards ride out of a vanishing point
 * toward the viewer, and the hero's own content sits over them.
 *
 * Ported from a TypeScript source. This project is CRA + JavaScript
 * (`components.json` has `tsx: false` and there is no tsconfig), so the
 * types became JSDoc and nothing else changed. The `@/` alias resolves to
 * `src/` through craco.config.js and jsconfig.json.
 *
 * ── the corridor ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two rails of cards ride from far behind the screen toward the
 * viewer. Perspective alone does the work that looks like two
 * animations: as a card's z grows it gets bigger *and* its screen x
 * sweeps outward from the vanishing point, because the projection
 * scales position and size by the same factor.
 *
 * Three things shape it, and each one fixes a specific artefact:
 *
 * 1. Depth is authored as *apparent size*, geometrically — each card
 *    is a constant ratio bigger than the one behind it, all the way
 *    out. Spacing a straight z-range evenly instead makes the near
 *    cards tear apart from each other as the projection blows up.
 * 2. The rails open hard in the first stretch and then hold
 *    (`fan` > 1). That opening cancels the — still slow — growth back
 *    there, so the ribbon leaves the centre as a flat band, bends
 *    once, and only then runs out on the diagonal. Parallel rails
 *    project to a straight cone with no bend at all.
 * 3. Neither end of the loop is ever on screen. A card dies with its
 *    inner edge past 50cqw, clear of the container's edge. And it is
 *    born *across* the axis — `railBirth` is negative, so the newest
 *    card starts on the far side and sweeps back through the centre.
 *    That plugs the throat: the axis stays covered at every instant,
 *    and a newborn lands behind cards that already cover it, so it
 *    needs no fade in. Birthing on its own side instead leaves a hole
 *    at dead centre that blinks open once every cycle.
 *
 * Every length is in `cqw` — a percentage of the container's width —
 * so the whole corridor keeps its proportions at any size. The
 * defaults were fitted numerically against a reference recording's
 * card-height and edge-position profile, not eyeballed.
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * Geometry of the corridor. Every length is `cqw`, a percentage of the
 * container's width, so the shape is resolution-independent.
 *
 * These interact: the ribbon only stays solid while consecutive cards
 * overlap, which needs `exitHeight / birthHeight` spread over enough
 * `cards`. Raising `exitHeight`, dropping `cards`, or pulling `railExit`
 * in all push toward a visible tear near the frame edge.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} CorridorPath
 * @property {number} [perspective=30] Strength of the projection. Lower is a wider-angle, more dramatic rush.
 * @property {number} [cardWidth=18] Card width in world units.
 * @property {number} [cardHeight=25] Card height in world units.
 * @property {number} [cardRadius=0.4] Corner radius applied to each card.
 * @property {number} [birthHeight=2.6] On-screen card height at the waist, where a card is born.
 * @property {number} [exitHeight=46] On-screen card height as a card leaves the frame.
 * @property {number} [railBirth=-11] Lateral offset at birth. Negative starts the card across the axis so the centre never opens up — see note 3 above.
 * @property {number} [railExit=44] Lateral offset once the rails have finished opening.
 * @property {number} [fan=3.3] How front-loaded the opening is. >1 opens early then holds.
 * @property {number} [turnBirth=6] Y-rotation at birth, degrees.
 * @property {number} [turnExit=28] Y-rotation at exit, degrees.
 * @property {number} [stops=24] Keyframe stops used to trace the curve. Raise only if motion looks faceted.
