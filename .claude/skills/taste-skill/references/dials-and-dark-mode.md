# Dial definitions and the dark mode protocol

Part of the `taste-skill` skill: Sections 7 (dial definitions) and 8 (dark mode protocol), moved here from SKILL.md to keep it short. Read it when setting dial values from Section 1, and before shipping any page with a dark mode.

## 7. DIAL DEFINITIONS (Technical Reference)

### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Symmetrical CSS Grid (12-col, equal fr-units), equal paddings, centered alignment.
* **4-7 (Offset):** `margin-top: -2rem` overlaps, varied image aspect ratios (4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (`grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`).
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, asymmetric layouts above `md:` MUST collapse to strict single-column (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px`.

### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only. `prefers-reduced-motion` is the default mode anyway.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus on `transform` and `opacity`.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals, parallax, scroll-driven animation (CSS `animation-timeline` or GSAP ScrollTrigger). Use Motion hooks. **NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`** - it is a hard ban, not a "prefer-not." See Section 5.D for the allowed alternatives.

### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps (`py-32` to `py-48`). Expensive, clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App):** Standard web app spacing (`py-16` to `py-24`).
* **8-10 (Cockpit):** Tight paddings. No card boxes; 1px lines separate data. Mandatory: `font-mono` for all numbers.

## 8. DARK MODE PROTOCOL

Dual-mode by default. Never assume light-only unless the brief is print-emulating editorial.

### 8.A Token Strategy (pick one, stick to it)
* **Tailwind `dark:` variant** (default for utility-first projects): every color utility paired with its dark variant (`bg-white dark:bg-zinc-950`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`).
* **CSS variables** (for shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, or component libraries with theming): define semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`) and swap values under `[data-theme="dark"]` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

### 8.B Do Not Prescribe Specific Colors Here
The brief and brand decide. This skill enforces only:
* **Contrast** - WCAG AA minimum for body text, AAA target for hero copy.
* **Hierarchy parity** - visual hierarchy that works in light must work in dark. If a CTA pops in light, it pops in dark.
* **Brand fidelity** - primary brand color stays recognisable. Don't desaturate the brand into a dark mode.
* **No pure `#000000` and no pure `#ffffff`** - use off-black (zinc-950, near-black warm gray) and off-white. Pure values kill depth.

### 8.C Default Mode
Respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless the brand insists. Add a manual toggle if either mode would lose key brand expression.

### 8.D Test in Both Modes Before Finishing
Open the page in both modes during development. Do not ship a page you've only seen in one mode.
